## Usage

You need Python 3.10 or greater. You also need the pygame package.

Then, just run with:
```commandline
python main.py
```

Afterwards, type the name of the rom you wish to run. (include .ch8 extension)
E.g. 
```commandline
Breakout.ch8
```

The roms should be stored in the ROMS folder.
You are then ready to play. The following keys are used to play.

```text

Q W E R
A S D F
Z X C V
```

When you are done, press the escape key to stop the interpreter.
